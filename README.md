# Employee-Attrition-Dashboard

The Employee Attrition Dashboard is a data visualization project created using Microsoft Power BI. The purpose of this project is to help businesses track and analyze employee attrition rates, which is the percentage of employees that leave an organization over a certain period of time.

To begin, the project required cleaning and processing the data, which involved importing data from various sources such as spreadsheets, databases, and other software tools. The data was then transformed and cleaned to ensure consistency, accuracy, and completeness. This step is crucial for creating accurate and meaningful visualizations.

Once the data was cleaned and processed, the next step was to create a dashboard. The dashboard was designed to provide an at-a-glance view of the employee attrition rate for the organization. The dashboard includes a variety of visualizations such as charts, graphs, and tables that are used to display key metrics and trends.

The Employee Attrition Dashboard includes a variety of metrics such as the total number of employees, the number of employees that left the organization, the attrition rate, and the reasons for employee turnover.

Overall, the Employee Attrition Dashboard provides valuable insights that can help organizations make informed decisions about employee retention strategies, workforce planning, and resource allocation. The project demonstrates the power of data visualization tools such as Microsoft Power BI in providing meaningful insights from complex and diverse data sources.
